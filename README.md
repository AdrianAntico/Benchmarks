This repo contains files for a data frames benchmark. Currently, the data frame pacakges tested include R's data.table, Python's Polars, and DuckDB. Others to come.

I plan on adding additional operations to this benchmark over time. Pull requests are welcome and so are issues and ideas!

## Replicate Benchmarks
1. Fork the repo
2. Modify Path variables at the top of each benchmark file
3. Run the scripts
